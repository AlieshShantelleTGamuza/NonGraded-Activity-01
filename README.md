- This repository contains 3 html files: index color bg.html, index img bg.html, and index.html.
- This is due to the fact that there were multiple website changes in the directions of the PDF.
- The code 'index color bg.html' has colors for the background and the text.
- The code 'index img bg.html' has an image for the background.
- The code 'index.html' is the final website seen at the last page of the PDF file that was given, with tags.
